Can talk about ingress, but We can’t actually do ingress, but if we could, here’s how we would do it.  

Pine planted @ 1200  
Survey says pine 3200  
Pine planted @ 1200 Pine ingress (natural) @ 2000  

Until we can run TASS with Ingress we have to ignore the natural component and simply use the Planted.  
Yes this is ignoring the natural volume.  

Ingress will be studied to see if there forest level effects beyond the stand level effects, but need TASS3 for all species to do this.

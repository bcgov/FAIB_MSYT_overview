# Multi Layered Stands

Multi-layered stands are a challenge because stands with a well stocked understory and a minimal overstory should be modeled as even-aged while complex multi-layered stands should be modeled differently.  The challenge is finding a set of rules to split stands into the 2 populations.  


While we are assessing FC layers, also try to identify uneven aged stands  

Multi layered, multi cohort, complex  

Mix of ages and heights that are not similar.  

in the future, TASS could be used to model all  “layers”   

Today we simply tag for the analyst.

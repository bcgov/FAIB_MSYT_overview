After assessing Planted data and FC data can look for problem areas  

Assign these for the analyst to review.  

No species, no planted data, missing fc data  

And NO we donâ€™t fix these.  We look for large problem areas.  IF that exists, we fix.  Otherwise, we identify these to be fixed for next round.

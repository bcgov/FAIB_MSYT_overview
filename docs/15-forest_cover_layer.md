Along with planting, we also use INV forest cover survey data to adjust species composition.  
Can adjust planted species for mortality and in a limited way ingress.  

Natural stand component comes from rslt_forest_cover INVENTORY survey data.  

forest cover polygon can have 1 to many layers   
Opening can have 1 to many forest cover polygons  

each layer can have up to 5 species  
there are also 2 age and 2 heights within each layer  

Looking for even aged stands

# Aggregate Inputs for TSR"

<br><br><br>

**Future stand aggregate represents current practice **

Weighted for each BEC Zone and Subzone :

- Planted Species comp, planting density, GW, planting delay
- Natural Species composition
- Weighted by planting history for the unit

Aggregate species composition assigned to each VRI feature_id that requries an aggregate yield.  

Site index for the feature_id  comes from the provincial site productivity layer (PSPL).

Using bec zone/subzone for high level grouping  
Weighted Planted species and  weighted natural species  

Derive the current planting practice percent: 88% planting 12% Natural  

Aggregate species composition combined with feature_id specific site index (from PSPL).  
Unit specific plant natural combination.  

Use the Tipsy feature of mixed plant natural to get one row input.

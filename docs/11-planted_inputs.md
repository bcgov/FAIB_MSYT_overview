# Planting Inputs

## Planted Inputs: Planting Species, Density and Genetic Worth

- area weighted
- Validation
  - Planted density > 300 sph and < 3000 sph
  - Fill plants and replants are not included
  - Disturbance start date after April 1, 1987

Need to derive a weighted species composition including density by species and GW by species.  
Opening can have 1 or more activities related to planting  

Lacking spatial data, assume activities are independent.  ## Planed Inputs  
In this case, 20.3 ha was planted, then 14 ha was planted = 34.3 total   

Rules: 300 < density < 3000  
Rule: FP and RP excluded  
Rule: pre 1987 stands handled differently  

Validation checks: opening has the required information to generate a yield table.  

Where information is missing (or extreme) The validation problem is flagged for review.  

If density is outside parameters, gets sent to RPB for checking   
Re-plants are not included because we assume that brings the density back to the initial density.    
Fill plants are not included as generally they only apply to natural stands.

# Forest Cover INV


**Natural Inputs: INV vs SILV information**

- natural composition comes from rslts_forest_cover_INV_svw
- we are NOT using the SILV survey information
- TASS/Tipsy require total stems per ha
- SILV has well spaced crop trees
- well spaced will generally underestimate volumes

to account for ingress or mortality need the **total stems** from INV

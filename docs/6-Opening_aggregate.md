# Aggregate to Opening

Everything in the MSYT process for managed stands is based on opening.  

Consider the following:

## Simple Opening

![](../images/op_simple.png)![](../images/op_fc.png)![](../images/op_fid.png)

<pre> 1) Opening                           2) Forest Cover Polygon(s)         3) VRI features </pre>


___

- Add the detail provided by the Forest Cover Survey.

- Add Opening feature(s) from VRI




___


Consider how the VRIMs process generalizes the Forest Cover spatial information.

Generalized Opening in VRI.


Example of an opening with multiple forest cover objects (4).  
Note that these have been generalized by the VRIMS load process to 4 features.    
 

Due to the complexity of RESULTS spatial, FC objects are generalized by VRI processing  
The individual polygons shown above are VRI features.

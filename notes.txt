Slide Commentary
0 - Opening Title Slide
	- making a silk purse out of a sow's ear
1 - Topics covered
	- RESULTS drive process for creating MSYTs
	- some detail of the process
	- more detail is available
2 - acknowledgements
	- cast of characters involved
3 - How this all came about
	- in general, most things seem easy
	- until you get into the details
4 - Previous Approaches
	- many differing derivations of producing yields
	- some district staff were heavily involved
5 - RESULTS approach
	- provincial
	- standardized
	- can be modified to address issues
6 - Aggregate to Opening
	- everything is derived at the opening
7 - BUT site index information is joined to feature_id
	- species composition is derived at opening
	- site index is assigned at the feature
8e - stand types
	- existing natural -> VDYP
	- existing managed -> MSYT
	- excluded
		- Alpine, BG
	- no site index exclusion
	- testing with BTC to see how this works
8m - stand types managed
	- special category pre 87 stands
9 - Process Flow simplified
	- where data comes from
	- assessment for ingress/mortality
	- builds MSYT input tables in a method that combines
		- planted and natural
		- conifer and deciduous
		- handles pre87 stands using backgrow
10 - format for BTC	
	- csv
11 - deriving planted inputs
		- from activity table
		- get # planted & area 
		- join to GW
		- assume that the individual activities are spatially separate
		- area weighted by species
			- species composition	
			- density
			- genetic worth

13 - planting delay
	- this is NOT regen delay
	- simply difference between harvest and planting dates
	- regen delay has many connotations to many people so we don't use it
	- in an MSYT, planting delay is simply an offset on x axis to start the MSYT
14 - Planted Percent
	- determines based on net area from FC how much of the opening was planted
	- loosely related to NAR
	- planted % is now modelled in BTC
15 - Forest Cover
	- how we determine what has happened between planting and survey time
	- survey is a measure of total species counts
16 - INV vs SILV
	- well spaced is a concept used for assessing free growing obligation release
	- it has no place in MSYTs
	- all growth models require total stems
	- issue is being discussed within the silviculture surveys folk right now
17 - Forest Cover provides us with the natural composition after planting
	- sort for things like
		- non productive
		- incomplete
		- residuals
		- grouped retention
	- classify features that are NOT assigned a MSYT
18 - layer processing
19 - weighted composition
20 - identify multi cohort stands
21 - multi cohorts left to analyst to determine yield
22
23 - when a planted species does not show up in the survey
24 - high mortality of species -> treat as natural
	- coast < 400
	- interior < 600
25 - true ingress
	- can't model this
26 - Validation Review
	- tagged features for the analyst to review
	- if not fixed, they go on a natural aggregate
27 - thinking back to 8m with the various categories
	- need to assign both a current and future yield

29 - development of aggregate curves
	- using a rolling 15 year time frame
	- ignore the latest 5 years
	- summarize BY BEC
	- may have to adjust this in some interior units
30 - aggregate species compostion
	- tsa weighted
	- joined to PSPL site index
31 - YSM volume to MSYT volume comparison
	- MSYT for each plot
	- average them all together
	- TASS vs BTC
	- feature_id vs opening
32 - YSM with remeasured plot
33 -
